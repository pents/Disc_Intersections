We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N ? 1. 
A zero-indexed array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given. 
The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].

We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ? K and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point
There are eleven (unordered) pairs of discs that intersect, namely:

discs 1 and 4 intersect, and both intersect with all the other discs;
disc 2 also intersects with discs 0 and 3.
Write a function:

int solution(int A[], int N);

that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of (unordered) pairs of intersecting discs. 
The function should return ?1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.

Given array A shown above, the function should return 11, as explained above.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2,147,483,647].
